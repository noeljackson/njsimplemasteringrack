# njsimplemasteringrack
A simple Ableton and MaxMSP mastering rack. 

WIP

1) EQ to cut super and sub sonic frequencies.

2) A compressor with a response EQ turned on (set to 50-80Hz typically)

3) A "sculpting" EQ. Here you can raise highs, cut where needed, and boost low end, pull out resonances, etc.

4) A limiter. I don't use a limiter on every track. There are other ways to attack this, but start with a very very very small amount of limiting. We are using a MaxMSP Limiter here.

Not included:

A meter. I will find, or make a free meter to share. For now, try this free meter: https://maxforlive.com/library/device/5005/loudness-meter
